	abstract = {We report Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations and broadband spectral modeling of the radio-loud active galaxy 4C +55.17 (z = 0.896), formally classified as a flat-spectrum radio quasar. Using 19 months of all-sky survey Fermi-LAT data, we detect a γ-ray continuum extending up to an observed energy of 145 GeV, and furthermore we find no evidence of γ-ray variability in the source over its observed history. We illustrate the implications of these results in two different domains. First, we investigate the origin of the steady γ-ray emission, where we re-examine the common classification of 4C +55.17 as a quasar-hosted blazar and consider instead its possible nature as a young radio source. We analyze and compare constraints on the source physical parameters in both blazar and young radio source scenarios by means of a detailed multiwavelength analysis and theoretical modeling of its broadband spectrum. Second, we show that the γ-ray spectrum may be formally extrapolated into the very high energy (VHE, ⩾100 GeV) range at a flux level detectable by the current generation of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. This enables us to place constraints on models of extragalactic background light within LAT energies and features the source as a promising candidate for VHE studies of the universe at an unprecedented redshift of z = 0.896.}

We analyze all the archival observations of the target with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the far-ultraviolet observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, and the 8.4 GHz map obtained with the Very Large Array. In our study, we focus on investigating the morphology of the outflow at different frequencies, and therefore we apply various techniques for the image deconvolution, paying particular attention to a precise modeling of the Chandra and Hubble point-spread functions. We find that the prominent brightness enhancements in the X-ray and far-ultraviolet jet of 3C 273—the “knots”—are not point-like, and can be resolved transversely as extended features with sizes of about . Also, the radio outflow is wider than the deconvolved X-ray/ultraviolet jet. We have also found circumstantial evidence that the intensity peaks of the X-ray knots are located systematically upstream of the corresponding radio intensity peaks, with the projected spatial offsets along the jet ranging from  up to . We discuss our findings in the wider context of multi-component models for the emission and structure of large-scale quasar jets, and speculate on the physical processes enabling an efficient acceleration of the emitting ultrarelativistic electrons along the entire jet length that exceeds 100 kpc.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We report an optical/UV jet and counterjet in M84, previously unreported in archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging. With archival VLA, ALMA, and Chandra imaging, we examine the first well-sampled spectral energy distribution of the inner jet of M84, where we find that multiple co-spatial spectral components are required. In particular, the ALMA data reveal that the radio spectrum of all four knots in the jet turns over at approximately 100 GHz, which requires a second component for the bright optical/UV emission. Further, the optical/UV has a soft spectrum and is inconsistent with the relatively flat X-ray spectrum, which indicates a third component at higher energies. Using archival VLA imaging, we have measured the proper motion of the innermost knots at 0.9 ± 0.6 and 1.1 ± 0.4c, which when combined with the low jet-to-counterjet flux ratio yields an orientation angle for the system of °. In the radio, we find high fractional polarization of the inner jet of up to 30% while in the optical no polarization is detected (<8%). We investigate different scenarios for explaining the particular multicomponent spectral energy distribution (SED) of the knots. Inverse Compton models are ruled out due to the extreme departure from equipartition and the unrealistically high total jet power required. The multicomponent SED can be naturally explained within a leptohadronic scenario, but at the cost of very high power in relativistic protons. A two-component synchrotron model remains a viable explanation, but more theoretical work is needed to explain the origin and properties of the electron populations.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We present the first high-resolution X-ray image of the jet in M87 using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. There is clear structure in the jet and almost all of the optically bright knots are detected individually. The unresolved core is the brightest X-ray feature but is only 2-3 times brighter than knot A (12.″3 from the core) and the inner knot HST-1 (1.″0 from the core). The X-ray and optical positions of the knots are consistent at the 0.″1 level, but the X-ray emission from the brightest knot (A) is marginally upstream of the optical emission peak. Detailed Gaussian fits to the X-ray jet one-dimensional profile show distinct X-ray emission that is not associated with specific optical features. The X-ray/optical flux ratio decreases systematically from the core, and X-ray emission is not clearly detected beyond 20'' from the core. The X-ray spectra of the core and the two brightest knots, HST-1 and A, are consistent with a simple power law (Sν ∝ ν-α) with α = 1.46 ± 0.05, practically ruling out inverse Compton models as the dominant X-ray emission mechanism. The core flux is significantly larger than expected from an advective accretion flow, and the spectrum is much steeper, indicating that the core emission may be due to synchrotron emission from a small-scale jet. The spectral energy distributions of the knots are well fitted by synchrotron models. The spectral indices in the X-ray band, however, are comparable to that expected in the Kardashev-Pacholczyk synchrotron model but are much flatter than expected in the pitch-angle isotropization model of Jaffe and Perola. The break frequencies derived from both models drop by factors of 10-100 with distance from the core.}

	abstract = {We present new Chandra observations of the radio galaxy 3C 445, centered on its southern radio hot spot. Our observations detect X-ray emission displaced upstream and to the west of the radio-optical hot spot. Attempting to reproduce both the observed spectral energy distribution and the displacement excludes all one-zone models. Modeling of the radio-optical hot spot spectrum suggests that the electron distribution has a low-energy cutoff or break approximately at the proton rest mass energy. The X-rays could be due to external Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background coming from the fast (Lorentz factor Γ ≈ 4) part of a decelerating flow, but this requires a small angle between the jet velocity and the observer's line of sight (θ ≈ 14°). Alternatively, the X-ray emission can be synchrotron from a separate population of electrons. This last interpretation does not require the X-ray emission to be beamed.}

This data set extends the current Chandra coverage of the 3CR extragalactic catalog up to redshift z = 1.0. Our sample includes 22 sources consisting of 1 compact steep spectrum source, 3 quasars (QSOs), and 18 FR II radio galaxies. As in our previous analyses, here we report the X-ray detections of radio cores and extended structures (i.e., knots, hotspots, and lobes) for all sources in the selected sample. We measured their X-ray intensities in three energy ranges, soft (0.5–1 keV), medium (1–2 keV), and hard (2–7 keV), and we also performed standard X-ray spectral analysis for brighter nuclei. All radio nuclei in our sample have an X-ray counterpart. We also discovered X-ray emission associated with the eastern knot of 3CR 154, with radio hotspots in 3CR 41, 3CR 54, and 3CR 225B, and with the southern lobe of 3CR 107. Extended X-ray radiation around the nuclei 3CR 293.1 and 3CR 323 on a scale of few tens of kiloparsecs was also found. X-ray extended emission, potentially arising from the hot gas in the intergalactic medium and/or due to the high-energy counterpart of lobes, is detected for 3CR 93, 3CR 154, 3CR 292, and 3CR  323 over a scale of a few hundred kiloparsecs. Finally, this work also presents an update on the state-of-the-art of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations for the entire 3CR sample.}

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present an analysis of newly acquired X-ray observations of 16 extragalactic radio sources listed in the Third Cambridge Revised (3CR) catalog and not previously observed by Chandra. Observations were performed during Chandra Cycle 17, extending X-ray coverage for the 3CR extragalactic catalog up to z = 1.5. Among the 16 targets, two lie at z < 0.5 (3CR 27 at z = 0.184 and 3CR 69 at z = 0.458); all of the remaining 14 have redshifts between 1.0 and 1.5. In the current sample, there are three compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources, three quasars, and an FR I radio galaxy, while the other nine are FR II radio galaxies. All radio sources have an X-ray counterpart. We measured nuclear X-ray fluxes as well as X-ray emission associated with radio jet knots, hotspots, or lobes in three energy bands: soft (0.5–1 keV), medium (1–2 keV), and hard (2–7 keV). We also performed standard X-ray spectral analysis for the four brightest nuclei. We discovered X-ray emission associated with the radio lobe of 3CR 124, a hotspot of the quasar 3CR 220.2, another hotspot of the radio galaxy 3CR 238, and the jet knot of 3CR 297. We also detected extended X-ray emission around the nuclear region of 3CR 124 and 3CR 297 on scales of several tens of kiloparsecs. Finally, we present an update on the X-ray observations performed with Chandra and XMM-Newton on the entire 3CR extragalactic catalog.}

	title = {The Origin of the X-Ray Emission in Two Well-aligned Extragalactic Jets: The Case for {IC}/{CMB}},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Over the past two decades, the most commonly adopted explanation for high and hard X-ray emission in resolved quasar jets has been inverse-Compton upscattering of the cosmic microwave background (IC/CMB), which requires jets that remain highly relativistic on 10–1000 kpc scales. In more recent years various lines of observational evidence, including gamma-ray upper limits, have disfavored this explanation in favor of a synchrotron origin. While the IC/CMB model generally predicts a high level of gamma-ray emission, it has never been detected. Here we report the detection of a low-state Fermi/LAT gamma-ray spectrum associated with two jetted active galactic nuclei that is consistent with the predictions of the IC/CMB model for their X-ray emission. We have used archival multiwavelength observations to make precise predictions for the expected minimum flux in the GeV band, assuming that the X-ray emission from the kiloparsec-scale jet is entirely due to the IC/CMB process. In both sources—OJ 287 and PKS 1510−089—the minimum-detected gamma-ray flux level agrees with predictions. Both sources exhibit extreme superluminal proper motions relative to their jet power, which argues for the well-aligned jets required by the IC/CMB model. In the case of PKS 1510−089, it cannot be ruled out that the minimum gamma-ray flux level is due to a low state of the variable core that only matches the IC/CMB prediction by chance. Continued long-term monitoring with the Fermi/LAT could settle this issue by detecting a plateau signature in the recombined light curve that would clearly signal the presence of a nonvariable emission component.}

X-ray detections of two knots in the 3C 17 jet are found and both of these features have optical counterparts. We derive the spectral energy distribution for the knots in the jet and give source parameters required for the various X-ray emission models, finding that both inverse Compton (IC)/cosmic microwave background (CMB) and synchrotron are viable to explain the high energy emission. A curious optical feature (with no radio or X-ray counterparts) possibly associated with the 3C 17 jet is described. We also discuss the use of curved jets for the problem of identifying IC X-ray emission via scattering on CMB photons.}

	abstract = {We analyze Chandra X-ray images of a sample of 11 quasars that are known to contain kiloparsec scale radio jets. The sample consists of five high-redshift (z ≥ 3.6) flat-spectrum radio quasars, and six intermediate redshift (2.1 < z < 2.9) quasars. The data set includes four sources with integrated steep radio spectra and seven with flat radio spectra. A total of 25 radio jet features are present in this sample. We apply a Bayesian multi-scale image reconstruction method to detect and measure the X-ray emission from the jets. We compute deviations from a baseline model that does not include the jet, and compare observed X-ray images with those computed with simulated images where no jet features exist. This allows us to compute p-value upper bounds on the significance that an X-ray jet is detected in a pre-determined region of interest. We detected 12 of the features unambiguously, and an additional six marginally. We also find residual emission in the cores of three quasars and in the background of one quasar that suggest the existence of unresolved X-ray jets. The dependence of the X-ray to radio luminosity ratio on redshift is a potential diagnostic of the emission mechanism, since the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB) is thought to be redshift dependent, whereas in synchrotron models no clear redshift dependence is expected. We find that the high-redshift jets have X-ray to radio flux ratios that are marginally inconsistent with those from lower redshifts, suggesting that either the X-ray emissions are due to the IC/CMB rather than the synchrotron process, or that high-redshift jets are qualitatively different.}

This is the highest redshift kiloparsec-scale X-ray/radio jet known. Analysis of archival very long baseline interferometry 2.3 and 8.6 GHz data reveal a faint one-sided jet extending out to ∼200 pc and aligned to within ∼30° of the Chandra/VLA emission. The 3.″6 distant knot is not detected in an archival Hubble Space Telescope image, and its broadband spectral energy distribution is consistent with an origin from inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons for the X-rays. Assuming also equipartition between the radiating particles and magnetic field, the implied jet Lorentz factor is ≈5. This is similar to the other two known z ∼ 4 kpc scale X-ray jet cases and smaller than typically inferred in lower-redshift cases. Although there are still but a few such very high redshift quasar X-ray jets known, for an inverse Compton origin, the present data suggest that they are less relativistic on large scales than their lower-redshift counterparts.}

	abstract = {A recent Chandra observation of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell  585 has led to the discovery of an extended X-ray jet associated with the high-redshift background quasar B3 0727+409, a luminous radio source at redshift z = 2.5. This is one of only few examples of high-redshift X-ray jets known to date. It has a clear extension of about 12″, corresponding to a projected length of ∼100 kpc, with a possible hot spot located 35″ from the quasar. The archival high resolution Very Large Array maps surprisingly reveal no extended jet emission, except for one knot about 1.″4 from the quasar. The high X-ray to radio luminosity ratio for this source appears consistent with the  amplification expected from the inverse Compton radiative model. This serendipitous discovery may signal the existence of an entire population of similar systems with bright X-ray and faint radio jets at high redshift, a selection bias that must be accounted for when drawing any conclusions about the redshift evolution of jet properties and indeed about the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes and active galactic nuclei in general.}

We argue that the X-ray emission comes from collisionally ionized material, originally cold gas that has been shock heated by the passage of the radio jet, rather than being photoionized by nuclear radiation. This hot plasma is also responsible for the depolarization at low frequencies of the radio emission from the jet and hotspots, which allows us to estimate the magnetic field strength in the external medium. We show that it is likely that both the cold emission-line gas and the hot plasma in which it is embedded are being driven out of the host galaxy of 3C 171 at supersonic speeds. A significant fraction of the total energy budget of the central active galactic nuclei must have been expended in driving this massive outflow. We argue that 3C 171, with its unusual radio morphology and the strong relation between the jet and large amounts of outflowing material, is a member of a class of radio galaxies in which there is strong interaction between the radio jets and cold material in the host galaxy; such objects may have been very much more common in the early Universe.}",

The X-ray observations reveal the details of the previously known extended X-ray halo around the radio galaxy. We show using X-ray spectroscopy that the X-ray emission is consistent with being shock-heated material and can be modelled with standard collisional-ionization models, rather than being photoionized by the active nucleus. On this basis, we can make a self-consistent model in which the X-ray-emitting plasma is responsible for the depolarization of some regions of the radio emission from the jets and hotspots, and to place lower and upper limits on the magnetic field strength in the depolarizing medium. On the assumption that the X-ray-emitting material, together with the previously known extended emission-line region and the outflow in neutral hydrogen, is all being driven out of the centre of the galaxy by an interaction with the jets, we derive a detailed energy budget for the radio galaxy, showing that the X-ray-emitting gas dominates the other phases in terms of its energy content.

We discuss in detail their X-ray morphologies and spectra. We find optical emission from one knot in the jet of PKS 1202-262 and two regions in the jet of PKS 0208-512. The X-ray emission of both jets is most consistent with external Comptonization of cosmic microwave background photons by particles within the jet, while the optical emission is most consistent with the synchrotron process. We model the emission from the jet in this context and discuss implications for jet emission models, including magnetic field and beaming parameters.}

	abstract = {We report Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations and broadband spectral modeling of the radio-loud active galaxy 4C +55.17 (z = 0.896), formally classified as a flat-spectrum radio quasar. Using 19 months of all-sky survey Fermi-LAT data, we detect a γ-ray continuum extending up to an observed energy of 145 GeV, and furthermore we find no evidence of γ-ray variability in the source over its observed history. We illustrate the implications of these results in two different domains. First, we investigate the origin of the steady γ-ray emission, where we re-examine the common classification of 4C +55.17 as a quasar-hosted blazar and consider instead its possible nature as a young radio source. We analyze and compare constraints on the source physical parameters in both blazar and young radio source scenarios by means of a detailed multiwavelength analysis and theoretical modeling of its broadband spectrum. Second, we show that the γ-ray spectrum may be formally extrapolated into the very high energy (VHE, ⩾100 GeV) range at a flux level detectable by the current generation of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. This enables us to place constraints on models of extragalactic background light within LAT energies and features the source as a promising candidate for VHE studies of the universe at an unprecedented redshift of z = 0.896.}

We analyze all the archival observations of the target with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the far-ultraviolet observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, and the 8.4 GHz map obtained with the Very Large Array. In our study, we focus on investigating the morphology of the outflow at different frequencies, and therefore we apply various techniques for the image deconvolution, paying particular attention to a precise modeling of the Chandra and Hubble point-spread functions. We find that the prominent brightness enhancements in the X-ray and far-ultraviolet jet of 3C 273—the “knots”—are not point-like, and can be resolved transversely as extended features with sizes of about . Also, the radio outflow is wider than the deconvolved X-ray/ultraviolet jet. We have also found circumstantial evidence that the intensity peaks of the X-ray knots are located systematically upstream of the corresponding radio intensity peaks, with the projected spatial offsets along the jet ranging from  up to . We discuss our findings in the wider context of multi-component models for the emission and structure of large-scale quasar jets, and speculate on the physical processes enabling an efficient acceleration of the emitting ultrarelativistic electrons along the entire jet length that exceeds 100 kpc.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We report an optical/UV jet and counterjet in M84, previously unreported in archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging. With archival VLA, ALMA, and Chandra imaging, we examine the first well-sampled spectral energy distribution of the inner jet of M84, where we find that multiple co-spatial spectral components are required. In particular, the ALMA data reveal that the radio spectrum of all four knots in the jet turns over at approximately 100 GHz, which requires a second component for the bright optical/UV emission. Further, the optical/UV has a soft spectrum and is inconsistent with the relatively flat X-ray spectrum, which indicates a third component at higher energies. Using archival VLA imaging, we have measured the proper motion of the innermost knots at 0.9 ± 0.6 and 1.1 ± 0.4c, which when combined with the low jet-to-counterjet flux ratio yields an orientation angle for the system of °. In the radio, we find high fractional polarization of the inner jet of up to 30% while in the optical no polarization is detected (<8%). We investigate different scenarios for explaining the particular multicomponent spectral energy distribution (SED) of the knots. Inverse Compton models are ruled out due to the extreme departure from equipartition and the unrealistically high total jet power required. The multicomponent SED can be naturally explained within a leptohadronic scenario, but at the cost of very high power in relativistic protons. A two-component synchrotron model remains a viable explanation, but more theoretical work is needed to explain the origin and properties of the electron populations.}

There is clear structure in the jet and almost all of the optically bright knots are detected individually. The unresolved core is the brightest X-ray feature but is only 2-3 times brighter than knot A (12.″3 from the core) and the inner knot HST-1 (1.″0 from the core). The X-ray and optical positions of the knots are consistent at the 0.″1 level, but the X-ray emission from the brightest knot (A) is marginally upstream of the optical emission peak. Detailed Gaussian fits to the X-ray jet one-dimensional profile show distinct X-ray emission that is not associated with specific optical features. The X-ray/optical flux ratio decreases systematically from the core, and X-ray emission is not clearly detected beyond 20'' from the core. The X-ray spectra of the core and the two brightest knots, HST-1 and A, are consistent with a simple power law (Sν ∝ ν-α) with α = 1.46 ± 0.05, practically ruling out inverse Compton models as the dominant X-ray emission mechanism. The core flux is significantly larger than expected from an advective accretion flow, and the spectrum is much steeper, indicating that the core emission may be due to synchrotron emission from a small-scale jet. The spectral energy distributions of the knots are well fitted by synchrotron models. The spectral indices in the X-ray band, however, are comparable to that expected in the Kardashev-Pacholczyk synchrotron model but are much flatter than expected in the pitch-angle isotropization model of Jaffe and Perola. The break frequencies derived from both models drop by factors of 10-100 with distance from the core.}

	abstract = {We present new Chandra observations of the radio galaxy 3C 445, centered on its southern radio hot spot. Our observations detect X-ray emission displaced upstream and to the west of the radio-optical hot spot. Attempting to reproduce both the observed spectral energy distribution and the displacement excludes all one-zone models. Modeling of the radio-optical hot spot spectrum suggests that the electron distribution has a low-energy cutoff or break approximately at the proton rest mass energy. The X-rays could be due to external Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background coming from the fast (Lorentz factor Γ ≈ 4) part of a decelerating flow, but this requires a small angle between the jet velocity and the observer's line of sight (θ ≈ 14°). Alternatively, the X-ray emission can be synchrotron from a separate population of electrons. This last interpretation does not require the X-ray emission to be beamed.}

This data set extends the current Chandra coverage of the 3CR extragalactic catalog up to redshift z = 1.0. Our sample includes 22 sources consisting of 1 compact steep spectrum source, 3 quasars (QSOs), and 18 FR II radio galaxies. As in our previous analyses, here we report the X-ray detections of radio cores and extended structures (i.e., knots, hotspots, and lobes) for all sources in the selected sample. We measured their X-ray intensities in three energy ranges, soft (0.5–1 keV), medium (1–2 keV), and hard (2–7 keV), and we also performed standard X-ray spectral analysis for brighter nuclei. All radio nuclei in our sample have an X-ray counterpart. We also discovered X-ray emission associated with the eastern knot of 3CR 154, with radio hotspots in 3CR 41, 3CR 54, and 3CR 225B, and with the southern lobe of 3CR 107. Extended X-ray radiation around the nuclei 3CR 293.1 and 3CR 323 on a scale of few tens of kiloparsecs was also found. X-ray extended emission, potentially arising from the hot gas in the intergalactic medium and/or due to the high-energy counterpart of lobes, is detected for 3CR 93, 3CR 154, 3CR 292, and 3CR  323 over a scale of a few hundred kiloparsecs. Finally, this work also presents an update on the state-of-the-art of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations for the entire 3CR sample.}

Observations were performed during Chandra Cycle 17, extending X-ray coverage for the 3CR extragalactic catalog up to z = 1.5. Among the 16 targets, two lie at z < 0.5 (3CR 27 at z = 0.184 and 3CR 69 at z = 0.458); all of the remaining 14 have redshifts between 1.0 and 1.5. In the current sample, there are three compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources, three quasars, and an FR I radio galaxy, while the other nine are FR II radio galaxies. All radio sources have an X-ray counterpart. We measured nuclear X-ray fluxes as well as X-ray emission associated with radio jet knots, hotspots, or lobes in three energy bands: soft (0.5–1 keV), medium (1–2 keV), and hard (2–7 keV). We also performed standard X-ray spectral analysis for the four brightest nuclei. We discovered X-ray emission associated with the radio lobe of 3CR 124, a hotspot of the quasar 3CR 220.2, another hotspot of the radio galaxy 3CR 238, and the jet knot of 3CR 297. We also detected extended X-ray emission around the nuclear region of 3CR 124 and 3CR 297 on scales of several tens of kiloparsecs. Finally, we present an update on the X-ray observations performed with Chandra and XMM-Newton on the entire 3CR extragalactic catalog.}

X-ray detections of two knots in the 3C 17 jet are found and both of these features have optical counterparts. We derive the spectral energy distribution for the knots in the jet and give source parameters required for the various X-ray emission models, finding that both inverse Compton (IC)/cosmic microwave background (CMB) and synchrotron are viable to explain the high energy emission. A curious optical feature (with no radio or X-ray counterparts) possibly associated with the 3C 17 jet is described. We also discuss the use of curved jets for the problem of identifying IC X-ray emission via scattering on CMB photons.}

	abstract = {We analyze Chandra X-ray images of a sample of 11 quasars that are known to contain kiloparsec scale radio jets. The sample consists of five high-redshift (z ≥ 3.6) flat-spectrum radio quasars, and six intermediate redshift (2.1 < z < 2.9) quasars. The data set includes four sources with integrated steep radio spectra and seven with flat radio spectra. A total of 25 radio jet features are present in this sample. We apply a Bayesian multi-scale image reconstruction method to detect and measure the X-ray emission from the jets. We compute deviations from a baseline model that does not include the jet, and compare observed X-ray images with those computed with simulated images where no jet features exist. This allows us to compute p-value upper bounds on the significance that an X-ray jet is detected in a pre-determined region of interest. We detected 12 of the features unambiguously, and an additional six marginally. We also find residual emission in the cores of three quasars and in the background of one quasar that suggest the existence of unresolved X-ray jets. The dependence of the X-ray to radio luminosity ratio on redshift is a potential diagnostic of the emission mechanism, since the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB) is thought to be redshift dependent, whereas in synchrotron models no clear redshift dependence is expected. We find that the high-redshift jets have X-ray to radio flux ratios that are marginally inconsistent with those from lower redshifts, suggesting that either the X-ray emissions are due to the IC/CMB rather than the synchrotron process, or that high-redshift jets are qualitatively different.}

This is the highest redshift kiloparsec-scale X-ray/radio jet known. Analysis of archival very long baseline interferometry 2.3 and 8.6 GHz data reveal a faint one-sided jet extending out to ∼200 pc and aligned to within ∼30° of the Chandra/VLA emission. The 3.″6 distant knot is not detected in an archival Hubble Space Telescope image, and its broadband spectral energy distribution is consistent with an origin from inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons for the X-rays. Assuming also equipartition between the radiating particles and magnetic field, the implied jet Lorentz factor is ≈5. This is similar to the other two known z ∼ 4 kpc scale X-ray jet cases and smaller than typically inferred in lower-redshift cases. Although there are still but a few such very high redshift quasar X-ray jets known, for an inverse Compton origin, the present data suggest that they are less relativistic on large scales than their lower-redshift counterparts.}

	abstract = {A recent Chandra observation of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell  585 has led to the discovery of an extended X-ray jet associated with the high-redshift background quasar B3 0727+409, a luminous radio source at redshift z = 2.5. This is one of only few examples of high-redshift X-ray jets known to date. It has a clear extension of about 12″, corresponding to a projected length of ∼100 kpc, with a possible hot spot located 35″ from the quasar. The archival high resolution Very Large Array maps surprisingly reveal no extended jet emission, except for one knot about 1.″4 from the quasar. The high X-ray to radio luminosity ratio for this source appears consistent with the  amplification expected from the inverse Compton radiative model. This serendipitous discovery may signal the existence of an entire population of similar systems with bright X-ray and faint radio jets at high redshift, a selection bias that must be accounted for when drawing any conclusions about the redshift evolution of jet properties and indeed about the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes and active galactic nuclei in general.}

We argue that the X-ray emission comes from collisionally ionized material, originally cold gas that has been shock heated by the passage of the radio jet, rather than being photoionized by nuclear radiation. This hot plasma is also responsible for the depolarization at low frequencies of the radio emission from the jet and hotspots, which allows us to estimate the magnetic field strength in the external medium. We show that it is likely that both the cold emission-line gas and the hot plasma in which it is embedded are being driven out of the host galaxy of 3C 171 at supersonic speeds. A significant fraction of the total energy budget of the central active galactic nuclei must have been expended in driving this massive outflow. We argue that 3C 171, with its unusual radio morphology and the strong relation between the jet and large amounts of outflowing material, is a member of a class of radio galaxies in which there is strong interaction between the radio jets and cold material in the host galaxy; such objects may have been very much more common in the early Universe.}",

On this basis, we can make a self-consistent model in which the X-ray-emitting plasma is responsible for the depolarization of some regions of the radio emission from the jets and hotspots, and to place lower and upper limits on the magnetic field strength in the depolarizing medium. On the assumption that the X-ray-emitting material, together with the previously known extended emission-line region and the outflow in neutral hydrogen, is all being driven out of the centre of the galaxy by an interaction with the jets, we derive a detailed energy budget for the radio galaxy, showing that the X-ray-emitting gas dominates the other phases in terms of its energy content.

We discuss in detail their X-ray morphologies and spectra. We find optical emission from one knot in the jet of PKS 1202-262 and two regions in the jet of PKS 0208-512. The X-ray emission of both jets is most consistent with external Comptonization of cosmic microwave background photons by particles within the jet, while the optical emission is most consistent with the synchrotron process. We model the emission from the jet in this context and discuss implications for jet emission models, including magnetic field and beaming parameters.}
